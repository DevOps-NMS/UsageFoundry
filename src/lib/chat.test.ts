/**
 * Covers `planProposal`, `chatPrompt` and `githubSlug`, and only those.
 *
 * Each is the same class of failure the rest of this suite is reserved for —
 * pure, silent, and expensive:
 *
 *  - `planProposal` is where text a model wrote becomes a process with write
 *    access to a directory. The branch that matters most is the one that is not
 *    there: nothing on a proposal may set a guard, a permission mode or an
 *    isolation choice, because the whole approval gate rests on those coming
 *    from a template a person wrote. A regression here type-checks perfectly
 *    and shows up as an agent running somewhere nobody chose.
 *  - `chatPrompt` decides whether a turn is billed with the thread or without
 *    it. Getting it wrong is invisible: a model that silently lost the
 *    conversation still answers confidently, and the reply reads as a
 *    misunderstanding rather than as amnesia.
 *  - `githubSlug` names the repository the chat then reads issues out of. A
 *    wrong answer is not an error — it is proposals for somebody else's
 *    project, described convincingly.
